# Left At Home
 My [submission](https://rodfireproductions.itch.io/left-at-home) to the [TRANS JOY JAM](https://itch.io/jam/transjoy).
 
 For some reason I decided to shove IfThenCreate's [Narrative Game Template](https://github.com/reaganhenke/narrative-game), Ju/Smwhr's [Binksi HD](https://github.com/smwhr/binksi), and Jermery Oduber's [EZM Reader](https://github.com/jeremyoduber/EZM-Reader) together.

Feel free to use this as reference.
